# quant_backtests

Noteboooks and data for several backtests that I ran in the summer of 2023.

The first is a replication of Bejamin Graham's stock screening criteria from chapter 14 of *Intelligent Investor*.

The second is a random forest model that utilizes a mix of technical and macroeconomic indicators to trade various mixes of an equity/bond portfolio.

If you wish to run the first backtest yourself, you will need to create a `.env` file to store the filepath for your chromedriver to be accessed by selenium. However, this notebook may not function as is since the scrapers may not work properly if the website structures have been updated.

Note the programming may be crude in some areas.
