# quant_backtests

Noteboooks and data for several backtests that I ran in the summer of 2023.

The first is a replication of Bejamin Graham's stock screening criteria from chapter 14 of *Intelligent Investor*.

The second is a random forest model that utilizes a mix of technical and macroeconomic indicators to trade various mixes of an equity/bond portfolio.
